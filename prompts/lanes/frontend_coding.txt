Lane focus: FRONTEND-STYLE CODING, locally testable in Python (v1 constraint).

Task style:
- Pure logic that mirrors frontend problems (state reducers, selectors, data transforms).
- Deterministic functions with clear tests.

Allowed task families:
- Reducer/state transition logic
- Debounce/throttle logic as pure function simulation
- Memoization cache utilities
- Transform API payload to UI view-model
- Form validation logic (pure function)
- Diffing/patch-like operations on lists (stable keys concept)

ADDITIONAL TASK FAMILIES:

ASYNC STATE SIMULATION:
- Simulate optimistic update rollback.
- Handle race condition resolution in pure logic.

COMPLEX REDUCERS:
- Nested state updates.
- Immutable update correctness.

SELECTOR OPTIMIZATION:
- Derived state memoization utility.
- Stable sorting with deterministic output.

ERROR HANDLING:
- Error boundary logic simulation.
- Fallback state management.

PERFORMANCE-AWARE LOGIC:
- Large list diff simulation.
- Avoiding unnecessary recomputation (cache invalidation).

For difficulty >=4:
- Include complexity awareness (Big-O reasoning in rubric).
- Include edge-case reasoning for large inputs.

Quality requirements:
- Clear function signature and docstring.
- Tests for edge cases (empty input, duplicates, ordering).
- For difficulty >=4 include performance-awareness constraints (big-O discussion in rubric).
