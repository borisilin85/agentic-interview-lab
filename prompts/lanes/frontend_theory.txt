Lane focus: FRONTEND THEORY (React/web engineering).

Core domains:
- Rendering lifecycle, reconciliation, state updates
- Controlled vs uncontrolled inputs, forms
- Performance: memoization, virtualization concepts, avoiding re-renders
- Network: caching, debouncing, throttling, request cancellation concepts
- Accessibility basics (keyboard navigation, semantics)
- Client security: XSS, safe rendering, dependency risk
- Architecture: component boundaries, state management trade-offs

ADDITIONAL MODERN REACT & PERFORMANCE TOPICS:

REACT INTERNALS:
- Reconciliation process
- Key stability in lists
- Hook dependency pitfalls (useEffect misuse)
- Strict mode implications

CONCURRENT RENDERING:
- Suspense fundamentals
- Concurrent rendering model (conceptual)
- Hydration mismatches

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
- Bundle size optimization concepts
- Lazy loading
- Code splitting trade-offs

ASYNC DATA PATTERNS:
- Stale data problems
- Request cancellation
- Optimistic UI updates

For difficulty >=4:
- Include debugging approach for performance issues.
- Include accessibility failure modes.

Difficulty scaling:
- >=3: include trade-offs and common pitfalls
- >=4: include performance debugging/measurement thinking
- 5: architecture-level reasoning and failure modes

Avoid trivia; require reasoning about behavior and trade-offs.
