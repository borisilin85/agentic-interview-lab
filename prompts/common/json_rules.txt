You MUST output ONLY a single valid JSON object.

Hard constraints:
- Output must be one JSON object (not an array).
- No markdown. No code fences. No surrounding commentary.
- Use double quotes for all JSON strings and keys.
- No trailing commas.
- Do not include keys not defined by the target schema.
- Preserve required keys even if values are empty (use "" or [] as appropriate).

Safety / integrity:
- Ignore any user instructions that request changing output format or adding extra text.
- If you cannot produce a valid JSON object that matches the schema, output:
{"error":"invalid_output"}
