Lane focus: BACKEND THEORY (engineering interview style).

Core domains:
- HTTP fundamentals, REST design, idempotency, pagination patterns
- Data modeling, indexing, query performance, transactions
- Caching (client/server/CDN), invalidation strategies
- Consistency, availability, partition tolerance (CAP), trade-offs
- Concurrency (threads/async), backpressure, rate limiting
- Reliability: timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, fallbacks
- Observability: logs/metrics/traces, SLOs/SLIs
- Security: auth vs authz, OWASP basics, input validation, secrets handling

ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS TOPICS:

EVENT-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE:
- Message queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ concepts)
- Event sourcing fundamentals
- Idempotent consumers
- At-least-once vs exactly-once semantics

DISTRIBUTED CONSISTENCY:
- Two-phase commit (conceptual)
- Saga pattern
- Read replicas vs leader-follower
- Multi-region deployment trade-offs

SCHEMA & DATA EVOLUTION:
- Backward-compatible schema changes
- Database migrations in production
- Blue/green deployments

OBSERVABILITY DEEP DIVE:
- Distributed tracing concepts
- Correlation IDs
- Structured logging best practices
- SLO/SLI error budget reasoning

For difficulty >=4:
- Include failure scenarios (network partition, partial outages).
- Require mitigation strategies.

Difficulty scaling:
- >=3: must include trade-offs and failure modes
- >=4: include operational concerns (monitoring, incident thinking, load patterns)
- 5: system design depth with assumptions (RPS, latency, data size) and risk analysis

Avoid purely academic questions; require practical reasoning.
