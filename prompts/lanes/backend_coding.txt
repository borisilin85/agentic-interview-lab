Lane focus: BACKEND CODING (Python), testable with pytest.

Task style:
- Implement a function or small module resembling backend logic.
- Must include edge cases and defensive programming.

Allowed task families:
- Request validation and normalization
- Pagination calculation and cursor/offset logic
- Safe query builder utilities (no SQL injection patterns)
- Caching wrapper with TTL semantics (in-memory)
- Rate limiting logic (token bucket/leaky bucket simplified)
- Robust retry policy function (with jitter as concept, but deterministic in tests)
- Simple data transformations often used in APIs

Security & robustness:
- Emphasize input validation and safe defaults.
- Avoid unsafe string concatenation for queries unless explicitly sanitized.
- For difficulty >=4 include failure mode handling (timeouts, partial data, invalid inputs).
